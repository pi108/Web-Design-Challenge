# This folder contains an analysis of:
The relationship between the Latitude of a city and:
1.	The Maximum Temperature observed for that city.
2.	The Humidity observed for that city.
3.	The Cloudiness observed for that city.
4.	The Wind Speed observed for that city.

# This folder contains the following items:
#### A folder called Resources which  has the csv file that contains the details of the 546 cities used for this analysis and also a jupyter notebook file that helps convert the csv file into an html file.
#### A folder called images, that contains 4 images, one for each of the relationships mentioned above.
#### A CSS file called “styles.css” which is used by the 7 HTML files in this folder.
#### 7 HTML files as follows:
#### index.html: 
This is the main html file that connects all the other files. This file can be seen at the following website:
https://pi108.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/
#### data.html: 
This file contains the underlying data of the 546 cities that were analyzed for this project.
#### comparison.html:
This file contains a comparison of the 4 relationships on one single page.
#### 4 “visualization.html” files: 
These 4 files contain the in-depth analysis of each of the 4 relationships mentioned above.

# Key Findings from our Analysis:
## Relationship between Latitude & Maximum Temperature:
There is a strong relationship between the Latitude and the Maximum Temperature observed in the 546 cities analyzed as part of this project. As we get closer to the equator (Latitude of 0 degrees) the Maximum Temperature gets higher (i.e. the weather becomes hotter). As we move away from the equator (Latitude of 0 degrees) the Maximum Temperature gets lower (i.e. the weather becomes cooler).
## Relationship between Latitude & Humidity:
There is no significant relationship between the Latitude and the Humidity observed in the 546 cities analyzed as part of this project. Another way to state this, is that there is a very weak correlation between the Latitude and the Humidity observed. This also implies that we cannot predict the Humidity based on the Latitude of a given city.
## Relationship between Latitude & Cloudiness:
There is no significant relationship between the Latitude and the Cloudiness observed in the 546 cities analyzed as part of this project. Another way to state this, is that there is a very weak correlation between the Latitude and the Cloudiness observed. This also implies that we cannot predict the Cloudiness based on the Latitude of a given city.
## Relationship between Latitude & Wind Speed:
There is no significant relationship between the Latitude and the Wind Speed observed in the 546 cities analyzed as part of this project. Another way to state this, is that there is a very weak correlation between the Latitude and the Wind Speed observed. This also implies that we cannot predict the Wind Speed based on the Latitude of a given city.
